# pathValidator
This project is simply checking if certain path is exist and create that folder path is not exist, we used it to handle the FTP need for certains case
where creating folders in .NET code is simpler than creating it inside FTP code. the code is very basic and not optimized for re-usability.
Thanks a lot
